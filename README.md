Using Cloudflare tunnel is great and it hides your IP address if you are hosting your home lab but I faced the issue that my ISP changed the IP every few months so I had to come up with this idea.
You can setup this docker container and route it to any subdomain you choose using Cloudflare tunnel reverse proxy.
